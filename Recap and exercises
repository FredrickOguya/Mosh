# ðŸ§  Challenge 1: Combine and Filter High Scorers
# You're given two lists:

# python
# Copy
# Edit
# students = ["Fred", "Liam", "Alice", "Brian", "Nina"]
# scores = [92, 67, 85, 43, 78]
# ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
# Use zip() and a list comprehension to generate a list of only the students who scored more than 70, formatted like:

# python
# Copy
# Edit
# ["Fred scored 92", "Alice scored 85", "Nina scored 78"]
# ðŸ”§ Hints:
# Use zip() to pair students with scores.

# Use an if condition inside the list comprehension.

# Use an f-string to format.


students = ["Fred", "Liam", "Alice", "Brian", "Nina"]
scores = [92, 67, 85, 43, 78]

combined = zip(students, scores)

output = [f"{student} scored {score}" for student,score in combined]

print(output)
