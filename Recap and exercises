# 🧠 Mega Comprehension Challenge
# You're given a list of people with their name, age, and favorite fruit:



# 🎯 Your Tasks:
# ✅ List Comprehension
# Get a list of names of people who are 18 or older.

# ✅ Set Comprehension
# Get a set of unique favorite fruits, all in uppercase.

# ✅ Dictionary Comprehension
# Create a dictionary that maps each name to their age only if the age is 18 or above.

# ✅ Generator Expression
# Build a generator that yields each person’s age squared, one at a time.

# ✍️ Try It Out:
# Here’s the starting point:

# python
# Copy code
# people = [
#     ("Alice", 24, "apple"),
#     ("Bob", 17, "banana"),
#     ("Eve", 30, "apple"),
#     ("Tom", 15, "mango"),
#     ("Liam", 28, "banana")
# ]

# # 1. List of adult names
# adults = [name for name, age, fruit in people if age >= 18]

# # 2. Set of favorite fruits in uppercase
# fruits = {fruit.upper() for _, _, fruit in people}

# # 3. Dictionary of name:age for adults
# age_dict = {name: age for name, age, _ in people if age >= 18}

# # 4. Generator for age squared
# age_squared_gen = (age**2 for _, age, _ in people)

# print("Adults:", adults)
# print("Fruits:", fruits)
# print("Adult Ages Dict:", age_dict)
# print("Age Squared:")
# for age_sq in age_squared_gen:
#     print(age_sq)

people = [
    ("Alice", 24, "apple"),
    ("Bob", 17, "banana"),
    ("Eve", 30, "apple"),
    ("Tom", 15, "mango"),
    ("Liam", 28, "banana")
]

# 1. List of adult names
adults =[name for name,age,fruit in people if age>= 18]

print(adults)

# 2. Set of favorite fruits in uppercase

fav_fruits = {fruit.upper() for name,age,fruit in people}
print(fav_fruits)

# 3. Dictionary of name:age for adults

adult_dict = {name:age for name,age,fruit in people if age>=18}

print(adult_dict)

# 4. Generator for age squared

age_squared = (age**2 for name,age,fruit in people)

for age in age_squared:
    print(age)
