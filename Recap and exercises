# 🧠 Challenge: Match Students to Subjects and Scores
# You're given three lists:

# students = ["Fred", "Liam", "Alice"]
# subjects = ["Math", "Science", "English"]
# scores = [75, 88, 92]
# 🎯 Goal:
# Use zip() and a list comprehension to produce this:

# python
# Copy code
# ["Fred scored 75 in Math", "Liam scored 88 in Science", "Alice scored 92 in English"]
# 🔧 Steps:
# Zip the three lists together.

# Use a list comprehension to generate the desired sentences.

# Your turn!

students = ["Fred", "Liam", "Alice"]
subjects = ["Math", "Science", "English"]
scores = [75, 88, 92]

combined = list(zip(students,scores,subjects))

output = [f"{student} scored {score} in {subject}" for student, score, subject in combined]

print(output)
