# Try this challenge:

# students = ['Fred', 'Liam', 'Alice']
# grades = ['B', 'A', 'C']
# Use zip() to:

# Combine them into pairs

students = ['Fred', 'Liam', 'Alice']
grades = ['B', 'A', 'C']

combined = list(zip(students,grades))

print(combined)

# Then, use a list comprehension to turn them into strings like:

# python
# Copy code
# ["Fred got B", "Liam got A", "Alice got C"]

sentence = [f"{student} got {grade} "for student,grade in combined]

print(sentence)
