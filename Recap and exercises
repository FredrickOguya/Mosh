# 🧠 Challenge: Grade Summary with Conditions
# You"re given:

# students = ["Fred", "Liam", "Alice", "Brian"]
# scores = [92, 67, 85, 43]
# 🎯 Goal:
# Use zip() and a list comprehension to generate:

# python
# Copy code
# ["Fred got A", "Liam got D", "Alice got B", "Brian got F"]
# 📋 Grading Scale:
# A = 90 and above

# B = 80–89

# C = 70–79

# D = 60–69

# F = below 60

# 🔧 Hints:
# Zip students and scores.

# Inside the list comprehension, use conditional logic to assign grades.

# Use f-strings to format the final message.
