# ðŸŽ¯ Problem:
# Youâ€™re given two lists:

# products = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Bananas"]
# prices = [120, 80, 100]
# Use zip() and a list comprehension to produce:

# python
# Copy code
# ["Apples cost 120", "Oranges cost 80", "Bananas cost 100"]
# âœ… Your task:

# Use zip() to combine products and prices.

# Use a list comprehension to build the final list.

 # Give it a try

products = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Bananas"]
prices = [120, 80, 100]

combined = list(zip(products,prices))

final_list = [f"{product} costs {price}"for product,price in combined]

print(final_list)
