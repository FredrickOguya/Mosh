# 🧠 Challenge: Filter Adults Only
# You're given a list of people with their ages:

# python
# Copy code
# people = [("Alice", 24), ("Bob", 17), ("Eve", 30), ("Tom", 15)]
# 🎯 Goal:
# Use list comprehension to create a list of names of people who are 18 or older (i.e., adults).

# ✅ Expected Output:
# python
# Copy code
# ['Alice', 'Eve']
# 🔧 Your Task:
# Use a list comprehension with a conditional to filter only the adults and return their names.

# Give it a try! Let me know if you want the solution afterward.


people = [("Alice", 24), ("Bob", 17), ("Eve", 30), ("Tom", 15)]


older = [name for name,age in people if age>17]

print(older)
