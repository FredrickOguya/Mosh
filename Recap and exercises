# ðŸ§  Challenge: Combine Book Details
# You're given three lists:

# python
# Copy code
# titles = ["1984", "To Kill a Mockingbird", "The Great Gatsby"]
# authors = ["George Orwell", "Harper Lee", "F. Scott Fitzgerald"]
# years = [1949, 1960, 1925]
# ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
# Use zip() and a list comprehension to generate the following formatted list:

# python
# Copy code
# [
#   "1984 by George Orwell (1949)",
#   "To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee (1960)",
#   "The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925)"
# ]
# ðŸ”§ Hints:
# Zip the three lists together.

# Use an f-string inside the list comprehension.
