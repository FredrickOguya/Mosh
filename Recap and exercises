# ğŸ§  Exercise
# Try this:

# Create a list of five student names.

# Loop over the list using:

# A simple for loop.

# range(len(...)) method.

# enumerate() method.

# In each loop, print the index and name.

# Send me your code when ready and weâ€™ll continue to adding/removing items after review!


students = ["fred", "Kelvin", "Rose", "Vivian", "Brian"]

for student in students:
    print(f"student at index {students.index(student)} is {student}")

for i in range(len(students)):
    print(f"student at index {i} is {students[i]}")

for index, student in enumerate(students):
    print(f"student at index {index} is {student}")
