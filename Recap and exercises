# roles = ["Leader", "Developer", "Designer", "Tester"]
# workload = [8, 6, 5, 3]  # In hours per day
# ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
# Use zip() and a list comprehension to generate the following formatted list:

# python
# Copy code
# ["Fred is the Leader and works 8h/day", 
#  "Liam is the Developer and works 6h/day", 
#  "Alice is the Designer and works 5h/day", 
#  "Brian is the Tester and works 3h/day"]

# Use an f-string for formatting.

team_members = ["Fred", "Liam", "Alice", "Brian"]
roles = ["Leader", "Developer", "Designer", "Tester"]
workload = [8, 6, 5, 3]  # In hours per day

combined = zip(team_members,roles,workload)

output = [f"{members} is the {role} and works {time}h/day" for members,role,time in combined]

print(output)
